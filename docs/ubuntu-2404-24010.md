# Ubuntu 24.04 to 24.10 

Documenting the upgrade dance steps.

## Tasks

### Update System

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install update-manager-core
```

### Current System Update Reboot
Ensure we've got all those updates installed.
```
sudo reboot
```

### Modify Release Target 
Allow system to go beyond lts to 24.10 by changing setting of `Prompt` 
to `normal` in the `/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades`

You can use `sed` to replace 'Prompt=lts' with 'Prompt=normal'
```
config_file="/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades"
if $(grep "^Prompt=lts" "$config_file"); then
    cp "$config_file" /tmp  # backup
    sudo sed -i 's/Prompt=lts/Prompt=normal/' "$config_file"
    diff $config_file  /tmp/$(filename $config_file)
else
    echo "Prompt is not lts ... skipping modifcation"
    grep "Prompt=" "$config_file"
fi
```

### Initate Upgrade to Beta
Initiate the Upgrade to the Beta Release.  The `-d` flag tells the system 
to look for a development release, which includes the beta of 24.10.

```
echo "sudo do-release-upgrade -d"
echo "follow interactive prompts"
```

Follow the On-Screen Prompts: The system will walk you through the upgrade 
process, including downloading new packages, handling configurations, and 
rebooting the system.


### Reboot to Upgrade
```
sudo reboot
```
